                        <p>Investing in whisky can be both a fun and profitable pastime, with prices for both rare
                           bottled and maturing cask whisky consistently on the rise over the last decade. Several
                           factors drive this rise in value, most notably scarcity and with an ever-increasing
                           demand for Scotch whisky globally the lack of supply to meet demand is the main contributing
                           factor.</p>
                        <p>Over the past eight years, HMRC export data has shown this rising demand, with the value in
                           exports of Scotch whisky increasing from just under £2.3 Billion back in 1996 to almost £4.8
                           Billion in 2018. </p>

                        <p>During the late 1970s, the Scottish whisky industry was producing vast quantities of whisky.
                           Fearing a glut in supply, forecasters wrongly predicted that future demand for whisky
                           would not be sufficient to sustain those levels of
                           production. This would lead to a vast number of distillery closures in the early 1980s with
                           19
                           distilleries closing between 1983 and 1985, and by 2002 distillery numbers in Scotland had
                           reached their lowest number for more than one hundred years.
                        </p>
                        <p>Since 2002 the number of Scottish whisky distilleries in production has risen in an attempt
                           to meet the current global demand for whisky, and by 2020 it is expected that the number of
                           operational distilleries will equal that of the number
                           operational in the late 1970s.</p>

                        <p>In what if often referred to as "The10-year drought" we are now entering a time were past
                           production levels have no means of meeting present demand. Whisky is a very time "consuming"
                           product to make, and unlike wine, it does not age in the bottle, it has to be aged in the
                           cask. The dilemma facing whisky makers over the last 20 years has been, do they bottle the
                           whisky
                           they have or do they keep it to age for longer. By 2020 a 40-year-old whisky would have had
                           to have been laid down in 1980, with an 18-year-old laid down in 2002.
                        </p>
                        <p>However, much of the whisky laid down in 1980 would have ended up bottled in 1998 at 18 years
                           of age, further compounding the problem we have today with the lack of aged whisky to meet
                           demand.</p>

                        <h3>RARE WHISKY FOR EVERYONE</h3>
                        <p>Platinum Cask is offering a unique rare whisky opportunity. We are pioneering a concept we
                           call “Cask Fractions”. This is an opportunity for everyone to start their own cask whisky
                           collection, with whisky from a huge variety of distilleries to choose from and for a very low
                           price of purchase.</p>
                        <p>A Cask Fraction is a percentage of the contents of a cask. Due to the fact that as a cask
                           ages, and its volume of spirit decreases (the angels share), the simplest way to break it
                           down is into fractions. Each cask is broken down into a different number of fractions
                           depending on its value
                           to get a conformed GBP 20.00 starting value for each fraction. Simply, the more valuable the
                           cask the more fractions will be available.</p>

                                 details we receive when re-gauging the cask. If the ABV% drops too low we will sell the
                                 cask. If a whisky cask goes below ABV 40% it will no longer be known as a whisky. Once
                                 a sale has gone through you will receive your money back through PayPal or as a refund

                              <h3><span>2.</span> Can I withdraw my fraction as Whisky?</h3>
                              <p>Yes, you can. However, we would encourage you not to do so as it would be an
                                 impractical way of purchasing a small quantity of cask whisky to drink. It also
                                 requires undue levels of cask handling during the maturation process and so the
                                 withdrawal fees to remove your fraction prior to the displayed sale date reflect the
                                 negative impact this action would put on the cask. If you were thinking of doing this,
                                 please read our terms and conditions on withdrawal before purchasing. If you would like
                                 to drink some nice whisky, please take a look at our bottles that we have for sale.</p>

                              <h3><span>3.</span> Why Buy Fractions?</h3>
                              <p>A lot of casks are priced beyond an individual’s comfort level and even if you, with
                                 some mates decided to chip in and buy a cask as a group there is still the ‘all your
                                 eggs in one basket’ factor to consider. With cask fractions, you can still get involved
                                 in cask stock even if you don’t have any mates. The appreciation as a percentage is the
                                 same on a fraction as it would be on an entire cask but at an affordable price. It
                                 makes a unique present to buy for friends and family as a gift. You own the percentage
                                 of liquid in the cask you are buying, so worst-case scenario you can drink it. In
                                 excess of 20% PA is possible on a small outlay of funds. You are able to trade your
                                 fraction.</p>

                              <p>Our concept cask was a February 2009 Dalmore cask aged for 8 years. We broke it down
                                 into 200 fractions, valuing each fraction at GBP 20.00. This gave the cask a total
                                 value of GBP 4,000.00. Anyone with any whisky knowledge will know that a Dalmore cask
                                 of this age is worth considerably more. Yet we sold it at this value to demonstrate
                                 that not only could we make a profit from our Cask Fractions system but so could the
                                 Fraction owners.</p>
