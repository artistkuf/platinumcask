                        <p><strong>(Fah Mai Holdings Limited referred to as FMH)</strong></p>
                        <p>As a part of the new Alcohol Wholesaler Registration Scheme (AWRS) and Warehouses keepers and
                           Warehoused Goods Regulations (WOWGR) FMH is required to conduct due diligence checks on
                           partners involved in the supply chain for alcoholic drinks. Fah Mai Holdings Limited will
                           require the following documents for a wholesaler to open an account to start trading and for
                           providing non duty paid and duty suspended goods to FMH. The same stringent due diligence
                           process will take place whether the relationship is that of </p>

                        <p>a new wholesaler supplying FMH, or a distillery or broker supplying non duty paid goods, or
                           if this is to be a new forward trading relationship with a wholesaler or retailer. FMH will
                           be carrying out a detailed due diligence check on every new relationship. We will be checking
                           that the people we are going to trade with pass certain credibility criteria.</p>

                        <p>Once we have connected with a new potential, we will do all web due diligence possible. We
                           will check their web address, to make sure they have a website. If they do not have a
                           website, we will check Google maps to see if the client’s location is visible if a physical
                           visit is not possible. We will look at the history of their brand online, companies house
                           checks to make sure they are filing annual returns and have no CCJ’s our court orders against
                           them. If any of the following are found this will hinder their ability, if no reasonable
                           explanation is provided, to proceed with us. We will google the company to determine if there
                           is or is not any bad reports about them. Once we have done all of the online research
                           possible, we will follow our onboarding process. In all cases we will take a face to face
                           physical meeting at their location of business.</p>

                        <p><strong>On Boarding process as follows:</strong></p>
                        <p>1. Speak with the client on the telephone and organize a zoom call if a face to face meeting
                           is not possible. We will then discuss the history of the company, their reasons for wanting
                           to supply our products and finding out their history.</p>

                        <p>2. We will then request the following list of documentation.</p>
                        <ul>
                           <li>Copy of Incorporation Certificate</li>
                           <li>AWRS and or WOWGR registration numbers will be required if applicable. (If we are
                              supplying another wholesaler an active AWRS will be required, if we are buying duty
                              suspended goods an active WOWGR registration certificate will be required.)</li>
                           <li>We will put the AWRS company number into the AWRS lookup at
                              https://www.gov.uk/check-alcohol-wholesaler-registration</li>
                           <li>This will ensure the companies AWRS is still current.</li>

                        <p>Once the supplier has sent the above information, the appointed accounts officer or another
                           trained member of the team will review it. The overall risk of the supplier will be
                           established. If the business is identified as a high-risk supplier, further questions will be
                           asked and site visits will be conducted as appropriate. Any suspicious retail pricing at
                           uneconomic levels or improper trading patterns will be reported to HMRC in a timely manner.
                        </p>
                        <p>All high-risk suppliers will be reviewed every three months; all other suppliers will be
                           reviewed on an annual basis.

                           to continue as a supplier. As with new suppliers, each supplier's risk will be established.

                           representatives to verify business records.</p>
                        <p>Specific guidelines have been developed for customers and suppliers. All customers and
                           suppliers must provide the required list of documents and completed questions for Fah Mai

                           Limited will only trade with a customer or supplier if they have passed the necessary risk
                           assessment checks. Fah Mai Holdings Limited will only work with suppliers in the alcohol
                           industry who accept payment by cheque or bank transfer. Cash payments are not permitted.</p>

                           immediately have all transactions ceased pending review. If the review is unsatisfactory, the
                           account will be closed indefinitely.</p>
