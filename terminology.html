                           <h2>Cask Fraction(s)</h2>
                        </div>
                        <p>Cask fractions are a concept Platinum Cask has created in order to divide a cask of maturing
                           whisky in a fair and logical manner. As whisky ages a certain percentage of the liquid is
                           lost each year through evaporation, this is colloquially referred to as “The Angles share”.
                           With a product such as aging whisky that becomes smaller over time, the best way to divide it
                           is by fractions rather than by a fixed unit such a litres.</p>

                        <p>The Cask Fraction Market Place is an online portal currently under development that will
                           allow Cask Fraction owners to buy and sell their Cask Fractions with other owners.</p>

                        <p>Single cask releases are limited bottlings of cask from our collection. They will be limited
                           to the number of bottles that can be drawn from a cask and cannot be repeated. Some bottlings
                           will form part of a series, such as “The Olympians”, others will be a stand-alone release.

                           <h2>The Angels Share</h2>
                        </div>
                        <p>The Angles Share refers to the loss of alcohol and water that makes up the whisky through the
                           process of evaporation. Over the time the whisky takes to age some estimates state that
                           between 7% to 9% can be lost through evaporation per year.</p>

                        <div class="pt-3">
                           <h2>The Devils Share</h2>
                        </div>
                        <p>The Devils Share refers to the volume of liquid that is absorbed by the wood of the cask.
                           This rate can be affected by the type of wood, the number of times a cask has been used
                           before or the volume of liquid that remains in the wood from its previous contents. It is
                           estimated that up to 10 litres can be absorbed by a virgin cask, this process is most notably
                           used (in reverse), when finishing whisky in a cask that had previously held another liquid.
                        </p>

                           <h2>Finishing</h2>
                        </div>
                        <p>Finishing is a process of moving the contents of one cask into another cask for a short
                           period of time before bottling. The aim of this process is to add extra colour or flavour to
                           and already aged whisky. Common finishing casks would be ex-sherry or ex-bourbon casks,
                           although casks that have previously held more exotic liquids are not uncommon.

                        </div>
                        <p>Teaspooning is a process of adding a small amount (a tea spoon full) of liquid from one cask
                           to another, by law creating a blended whisky. This is mostly done with casks that are
                           produced for the sole purpose of blending and is done by a distillery to protect their brand
                           identity, by preventing their name being used by independent bottlers. In reality the process
                           of Teaspooning has far less of an effect to the whisky than the process of finishing would.

                           depending on who you talk to. ALA stands for Actual Level of Alcohol. Essentially it refers
                           to the most current measurement of the total volume of alcohol in a cask.

                        <p>The strength referrers to the percentage of alcohol in the whisky, otherwise known as ABV, or
                           Alcohol By Volume. This will normally decrease over time as alcohol evaporates at a lower
                           temperature to water, causing the alcohol content to reduce quicker. Cask of new make spirit
                           are normally filled between a high 50’s to mid 60’s of strength. (58% - 65% ish) For whisky
                           to be classed as whisky it must not drop below 40% That is why most mass produced younger
                           aged or NAS blends and Single Malts are bottled at 40% ABV.

                           produced on mass, often blended and bottled without stating the age of the whisky.

                        <p>The number of times a cask has been filled. However, a 1st fill bourbon barrel would have
                           been filled for a second time when a whisky was added to it, and a 2nd fill bourbon barrel
                           would have most likely had a whisky aged in it following its original bourbon but prior to
                           its current whisky, therefore being filled for a third time.

                           used will have less wood activity remaining to age the whisky. However, they do offer
                           significantly more chance of imparting an influence of their previous contents onto the

                           <h2>Barrel</h2>
                        </div>
                        <p>Barrels are one of the most commonly used cask types in the Scottish whisky industry. A
                           Barrel holds approximately 200 litres of liquid and is the primary variety of cask used in
                           the American bourbon industry. By law bourbon must be aged in a charred barrel made of
                           American white oak that has not been used before. Due to the restrictions on the reuse of
                           barrels for aging bourbon many of these barrels are sold to the Scottish whisky industry to
                           age whisky.

                        </div>
                        <p>Hogsheads are the second most common type of cask to be used to age Scottish whisky. A
                           Hogshead is typically a remade barrel constructed form the staves of barrels that have
                           previously held bourbon or sherry. As a remade cask Hogsheads are slightly larger than a
                           barrel, holding on average up to 250 litres.

                           <h2>Butt</h2>
                        </div>
                        <p>Butts are most commonly used to age Sherry and traditionally have been made using Spanish
                           oak. Today a large amount of Butts are made using American white oak, with both varieties
                           typicaly holding up to 500 Litres of liquid. Historically when sherry was shipped to the UK
                           the Sherry Butts were discarded after they had been emptied, this led to them being used to
                           age Scottish whisky. Today following the advent of plastic these cask are no longer used to
                           ship sherry and so many of todays “Ex Sherry Casks” are in fact purpose made to deliver the
                           same results.

                        <p>Barriques are the most common type of wine cask, originally from the Bordeaux region in
                           France they traditionally hold approximately 225 Litres. The Barriques smaller size was
                           favoured by wine maker who wished to give the oak more influence during the aging of the
                           wine.
